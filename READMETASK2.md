TASK TWO:MODEL EVALUATION AND COMPARISION
Evaluating the performance of AI models is crucial for determining
their effectiveness in solving a particular problem. This task
involves implementing and comparing different AI models using
appropriate evaluation metrics..


Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to evaluate and compare the performance of multiple machine learning models using a standard dataset. By implementing different models and analyzing their results using evaluation metrics, this project provides insights into the effectiveness of various algorithms for solving a classification problem.

Key Features of the Project
1.Implementation of multiple machine learning models.
2.Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
3.Output comparison to determine the best-performing model.


Objectives

Primary Objectives
1.Train multiple machine learning models on a dataset.
2.Evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.
3.Compare the results to identify the most effective algorithm.

Secondary Objectives
1.Save the evaluation metrics for future reference.
2.Provide a structured approach to model evaluation for beginner AI practitioners.


Steps Performed
1. Loading the Dataset
Used the Iris dataset as the default dataset for model evaluation.
Prepared the dataset by separating features (X) and the target (y).
2. Splitting the Dataset
Divided the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets.
3. Model Training
Implemented two machine learning models:
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Model Evaluation
Calculated key metrics for each model:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
Displayed the detailed classification report for each model.
5. Result Comparison
Compiled the metrics into a summary table to compare model performances.
Saved the summary table as a CSV file (model_evaluation_metrics.csv).
